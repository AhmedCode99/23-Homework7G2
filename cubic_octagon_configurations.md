# Tetramer NaCl Configurations:
The tetramer form of NaCl consists of four NaCl molecules.
the predicted equilibrium distance as calculated using theory is 2.312 \AA. and the emperical value was 2.36 $\AA$. [1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/201976884_Evolving_few-ion_clusters_of_Na_and_Cl).
